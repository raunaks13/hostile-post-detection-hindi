# hostile-post-detection-hindi

We preprocessed a dataset of posts in Hindi and detected hostile (fake, hate, defamation, and offensive) posts from this data using a variety of models.
After initial preprocessing we implemented an RNN baseline as well as a set of BERT-based NLP models in their respective ipynb notebooks. 

Our code uses PyTorch. We ran the notebooks with the standard GPU on google colab.

We used the dataset given as part of the CONSTRAINT 2021 task to classify hindi posts and our processed version can be found in the data folder. Further details regarding the dataset, our models, analysis, and results are provided in our [report](report.pdf).
There is also a [presentation](presentation) which summarizes our findings and results.
