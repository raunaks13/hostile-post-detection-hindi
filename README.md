# hostile-post-detection-hindi

We performed classification of a dataset of Hindi posts into the following categories: non-hostile, fake, hate, defamation, and offensive
After initial preprocessing we implemented an RNN baseline as well as a set of BERT-based NLP models. These can be found in their respective ipynb notebooks. 
Our code uses PyTorch. We ran the notebooks with the standard GPU on google colab.

We used the dataset given as part of the CONSTRAINT 2021 task to classify hindi posts and our processed version can be found in the data folder. Further details regarding the dataset, our models, analysis, and results are provided in our thorough [report](report.pdf).
There is also a [presentation](presentation) which summarizes our findings and results.
